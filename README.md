## Introduction

This website aims to provide end-to-end management services for rental property portfolios. It helps landlords find suitable tenants, facilitates property purchases, and handles compliance and repairs.

## About

I chose to create this website as I had done some work in this field.
The goal of this site is to reasure and provide peace of mind to landlords, the reviews section shows that they will be in good hands. This website has been made with a clear goal of providing peace of mind to property owners, which can be seen on the home page and on the services.html page.

## Problems

I have had many stressfull problems whilst creating this site.
Firstly I had been using the terminal incorrectly, which resulted in none of my work being submitted to GitHub for the first part of my project, I luckily didn't lose any of my work. I also stupidly didn't document my problems straight away and relied on remebering my problems which didn't work.

I have also tried to use Bootstrap in my project, however I only added it in middle of the project so it messed up some of the styles that were already working well, so I decided not to include it.

My problem as seen in the Screenshot was that I was trying to create 3 boxes to showcase our services but I was trying to use a table to do that which wasn't ideal.

I also struggled with making sure the #cover-text works on smaller devices.

## Testing

I used <https://www.w3schools.com> to test for bugs.
I also used Lighthouse from Chrome develepor tools.

## Credit

I looked at previous projects I had works on to gain some inspiration.

<https://www.w3schools.com/> was also a good tool, they also allow you to run small snippets of code to see how they would work.
Images have been downloaded straight from google chrome.
